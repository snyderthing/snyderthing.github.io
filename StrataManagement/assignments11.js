        // Question 1
        question: `Strata Corporation ABC (“ABC”) contains 120 strata lots, 80 of which are apartment-style units located in a single high-rise tower, and 40 of which are townhouse-style units located in multiple separate buildings on the strata property. The townhouse owners do not have access to the high-rise tower. There is a separate amenities building on the property to which all owners have access. The townhouse owners are unhappy about having to contribute to expenses that they feel relate solely to the high-rise tower. Therefore, the townhouse owners would like to amend ABC’s bylaws to create two sections: an apartment section and a townhouse section. At the following AGM, which all of ABC’s owners attend, resolutions to amend the bylaws to create the two sections were put to a vote. Brenda, the strata manager, accurately counts and records the following results:<br><br>
