		<div class="ingredients">
			<p>1 cup of margarine or butter</p>
			<p>1 cup of brown sugar</p>
			<p>&frac12; cup of white, granulated sugar</p>
			<p>2 cups of flour</p>
			<p>1 tsp baking soda</p>
			<p>1 tsp salt</p>
			<p>2 cups of chocolate chips</p>
			<p>2 eggs</p>
			<p>2 tsp vanilla extract</p>

			<p>Parchment paper is great. You can just slide the paper off of the cookie sheet onto the counter for cooling.</p>
			<p>I usually use margarine because it&rsquo;s soft and butter is usually hard. If you want butter and you&rsquo;re thinking ahead, I imagine you could leave the butter out of the fridge so that it&rsquo;s soft. As for me, I usually make them spur of the moment, so margarine works best for me. I have no idea if it makes much of a difference flavour-wise.</p>
			<p>I like the darker brown sugar. Maybe I&rsquo;ve used demerara. Maybe it was some that was darker from more molasses or something. But I&rsquo;m not so picky and I&rsquo;ll make them with whatever brown sugar I have on hand.</p>
			<p>I use a full teaspoon of salt, but I&rsquo;ve made cookies for people who think less salt is healthier. They&rsquo;re cookies. I&rsquo;m not so concerned about the healthiness of my cookies. If you want, use three grains of salt and substitute broccoli for the chocolate chips.</p>
			<p>I&rsquo;ve made the cookies with gluten-free flour before. Usually that means having to increase the amount of flour. That&rsquo;s an experiment every time. I didn&rsquo;t do it enough to nail down the exact increase.</p>

			<p>Cream together the margarine, the brown sugar, and the white sugar.</p>
			<p>Mix the eggs and the vanilla extract in with the margarine and sugar mix.</p>
			<p>Mix in the flour, salt, and baking soda.</p>
			<p>Add the chocolate chips (or broccoli chunks or M&amp;Ms)</p>
			<p>Drop the cookie dough from a spoon onto the parchment paper on the cookie sheet(s). I often fit two cookie sheets on the oven rack.</p>
			<p>Bake at 350 degrees Fahrenheit for about 12 minutes.</p>
